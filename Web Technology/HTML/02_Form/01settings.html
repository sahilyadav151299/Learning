        <!--  action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted -->
        <!--  Usually, the form data is sent to a file on the server when the user clicks on the submit button -->
        <!--  target attribute specifies where to display the response that is received after submitting the form -->    
        <!--  method attribute specifies the HTTP method to be used when submitting the form data -->
        
        <!--  
            GET  :  Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs
                    the submitted form data is visible in the URL!
                    The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters)
                    GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google
                
            POST :  Appends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request 
                    the submitted form data is not shown in the URL
                    POST has no size limitations, can be used to send large amounts of data.
                    Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked -->

        <!--  When autocomplete is on, the browser automatically complete values based on values 
              that the user has entered before -->
              
        <!--  novalidate, When present, it specifies that the form-data (input) should not be validated when submitted -->      

        <!--  enctype specify the encoding type -->
