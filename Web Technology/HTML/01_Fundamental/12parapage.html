    <h2 id="deepLink">HTML</h2>
    <pre style="font-size: 40px;">
        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup 
        language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
        It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets 
        (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from 
        local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
        HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally 
        included cues for the appearance of the document.

    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <pre style="font-size: 40px;">
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for 
        describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language 
        such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, 
        alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

        CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, 
        including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve 
        content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the 
        specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages 
        to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file 
        which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well 
        as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between 
        the pages that share the file and its formatting.
