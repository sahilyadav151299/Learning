TypeScript is 
	- 	An open source language
	- 	Superste of JS
	- 	Compiles down to regular JS
	- 	Can be used for front-end JS as well as backwend with Node.js
	- 	Includes most features from ES6, ES7
	- 	Using types completely optional
	- 	Offers additional features to JS including static types	


Static typed language 
	- 	Explicitly assign types to variables, function parameters, return values etc	
	- 	Ex. Java, C, C++, Go


Dynamic typed language	
	- 	Types are associated with runtime values and not named explicitly in code
	-	Ex. JavaScript, Python


Pros	-	More robust						Cons	-	More code to write
		-	Easily spot bugs						-	More to learn
		-	Readability								-	Required compilation
		-	Popular									-	Not true static typing


Compiling TypeScript
	-	TypeScript uses .ts and .tsx extensions
	-	TypeScript compiler (TSC) is used to compile .ts files down to JS
	-	Can watch files and report errors at compile time
	-	Mant tools include TS compilation by default
	-	Most IDE's have great support for TS
	-	The tsconfig.json file is used to configure how TypeScript works


Install TypeScript Compiler	
	-	npm install -g typescript
	-	tsc -v

Compile .ts to .js
	-	tsc file_name	
	-	By deafult compiles to ES5 
	-	let in .ts to var in .js
	-	tsc : compile any .ts file in project

Config TS target ES5 to ES6 
	-	tsc --init
	-	set "target" : "ES6"
	-	let in .ts to let in .js with 'use strict'	
	-	tsc file_name

JS files usuallt takes place in dist folder
	-	"outDir" : "./dist"
	-	"rootDir" : "./src"
	-	tsc only
	-	tsc file_name compile in the same folder

Continuously compile and problems in .ts file 
	-	tsc --watch
